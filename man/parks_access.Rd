\arguments{
\item{address_location}{A spatial object representing the location of interest, the location should be in projected coordinates.}

\item{parks}{A spatial object representing parks}

\item{buffer_distance}{A distance in meters to create a buffer or isochrone around the address location}

\item{network_file}{An optional sfnetwork object representing a road network, If missing the road network will be created.}

\item{download_dir}{A directory to download the network file, the default will be \code{tempdir()}.}

\item{speed}{A numeric value representing the speed in km/h to calculate the buffer distance (required if \code{time} is provided)}

\item{time}{A numeric value representing the travel time in minutes to calculate the buffer distance (required if \code{speed} is provided)}

\item{city}{When using a network buffer, you can add a city where your address points are to speed up the process}

\item{UID}{A character string representing a unique identifier for each point of interest}
}
\value{
The distance to the nearest fake entries of parks and whether the parks are within the buffer distance that is given
